Please read me before starting the third tutorial.

This week we will be learning a lot about the sampling distribution of the mean. 

In last weeks lab you were introduced to a dataset looking at social media use in young adults. That data comes from a research programme run here at UNSW. However, this experiment has been repeated at 500 universities across the world, to get an in-depth global understanding of social media use in young adults.
Today you are going to look at your dataset from the last computing lab, and the data from across 500 universities.

This dataset is called 'global_social_media.csv'. The following is a brief summary of this dataset:

The dataset contains 2 variables: uni_id and mean_time_on_social

uni_id: University ID number. Like the subject ID from last computing lab, but for each university taking part in the study. UNSW’s ID is ‘U49’

mean_time_on_social: the mean recorded for time_on_social from each experiment, where each experiment was conducted at a different university.

Note: 
We introduce an extension exercise for this week for students that finish early. Please be clear, that this exercise is optional but available for students that wish to extend their understanding of the importance of the sampling distribution of the mean.
