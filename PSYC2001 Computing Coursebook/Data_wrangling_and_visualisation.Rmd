## Checking installation and loading packages

Before we can **begin** any script we first need to make sure that the **required packages are installed** in our version of RStudio. Next, we can **load the required packages** to be used in the script. The code block below will do this for you.

Note that in the code below, we've added a fancy `if` statement to check if the packages are installed. If they are not installed, it will install them for you. This is a good practice to ensure that your code runs smoothly on any computer without needing to manually install packages. Particularly if you are using the University's computers, where we have already installed the packages you need (and we ask you not to install any more!).

```{r  message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# Check if packages are installed, if not install.
if(!require(here)) install.packages('here') #checks if a package is installed and installs it if required.
if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages('tidyverse')
if(!require(ggplot2)) install.packages('ggplot2')

library(here) #loads in the specified package
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

## What do packages do?

You should be able to see that we have installed and loaded **3 different packages**. Let's first go over the basics of what a package is. In its simplest terms, a **package is a toolbox** that someone has created for us in R that **makes our life easier**. These packages build on the basic code that comes with the R programming language (what **RStudio** uses to run), called `base R`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Opening an R package"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/All%20images%20for%20computing%20tutorials/Data_wrangling_and_visualization/Opening%20an%20R%20package.gif?raw=true")
```

## What do these packages do?

It is always a **good idea to check the documentation** for a package before you use it. We can do this by using the **help syntax**, which is the `?`. The package we are trying to get help with is called `here`. Try to run this code by **clicking on the green arrow on the corner of the code block on the left side of your screen**. This will open a webpage that tells us the **purpose** of the `here` package and how it works.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Running code in R"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/All%20images%20for%20computing%20tutorials/Data_wrangling_and_visualization/Example%20of%20running%20code.jpg?raw=true")
```


```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
?here #? loads the documentation for a specified package.
```

## Activity 1 - Using help syntax

**Fill in the code block below** by putting in the **help syntax** `?` and the name of the package you are interested in. This will get the documentation for the **other packages** we are using. You can do this by substituting in the packages that we are using from above. Have a read of each of these pages and click on any links you find interesting. These are the **main packages** we will be using throughout this course.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Try to use the help function '?' to read more about the packages we are using today
# The packages we are using are 'tidyverse' and 'ggplot2'.

?tidyverse
?ggplot2
```

## Organisation and CSV files

The dataset we are using should be downloaded from the tutorial folder on Moodle. On your computer navigate to this folder and have a look at what it contains.

You should note that it contains the following:

- An R Project file called **'Data_wrangling_and_visualization.Rproj'**
- An R Markdown file called  **'Data_wrangling_and_visualization.Rmd'**.
- A text file called **README.txt'**
- A folder called **data**, containing a .csv file called **'PSYC2001_social-media-data.csv'**
- A folder called **output**, which is where all your output will go. 
- A folder called **scripts** which is where all new scripts will go.  

These are the **key ingredients needed to organise all projects in R**.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Project Organisation"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/All%20images%20for%20computing%20tutorials/Data_wrangling_and_visualization/Example%20of%20folder.JPG?raw=true")
```


You will notice that the data for today, called `PSYC2001_social-media-data.csv`, is a **csv file** (short for a *Comma Separated Value* file). 

csv files are a common and handy way to store data, because they can be read by heaps of different programs, like Excel, Google Sheets, and R. They are simple text files where each line represents a row of data, and the values in each row are separated by commas. Try double clicking on the csv file now to see what happens. You'll see that Excel offers to open it for you. Click ok to open the file in Excel and take a look at how the data looks. Then say 'that's very kind of you Excel, but we are more powerful than you. We R.'

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Social Media Data in Excel"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/All%20images%20for%20computing%20tutorials/Data_wrangling_and_visualization/Data%20in%20excel.JPG?raw=true")
```

## Importing your Data in R 

We are now going to load our first dataset into R. To do this we will need to **import the dataset** using a function capable of importing csv files. 

We will be using **two different functions** to achieve this. The `read.csv()` function is used to import our csv dataset and it comes from the `utils` package which is part of `base R`. But the `read.csv()` function needs to know where the file lives on the computer. To do this, we use the `here()` function from the `here` package. This function tells R the **location of the project** we are working from, to make locating the data easier.

Let's first confirm that `here()` knows our current location on this PC (called the **'Working Directory'**)

```{r}
here()
```

We can use this to easily find where our file is located and read it. 

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
social_media <- read.csv(file = here("Data","PSYC2001_social-media-data.csv")) #reads in csv files

```

Note that this code works because 'Data' is a folder in the same directory as the `.Rproj` file. If the folder Data was somewhere else, then using `here()` would not work. We would need to instead specify the full path to the file. If you are unsure what we mean by 'file path' then please google it, google it now.

## Having a look at our imported data

Our data should now be **imported into R!**

Recall from the `README.txt` file (**make sure you read this**) that this dataset was collected as part of an experiment investigating social media use in young Australian adults. Sixty young adults answered questions about their **social media usage** as well as their **political attitudes**. Data about their **social media usage** (e.g., likes) was collected while they used their preferred platforms under various conditions.

The variables in the data are:

- `id` – a unique identifier (S1–S60)
- `age` – age in years
- `time_on_social` – average hours/day on social media (self-report diary)
- `urban` – urban (1) or rural (2) area (based on postcode density)
-` good_mood_likes` – likes/10 min during a good mood (from platform + diary)
- `bad_mood_likes` – as above, but during bad mood
- `followers` – average number of followers across platforms

The next 3 columns are political attitude subscales:

- `informed` – how politically informed they feel (e.g., read news daily)
- `campaign` – how much they engage in campaign-related discussion
- `activism` – involvement in activism (e.g., protests, petitions)

We should now check that we have **imported into Rstudio matches this description (and what we saw when we opened it in excel)**.  There are a couple of ways to do this.

- The first way is to **manually click** through to the dataset. You can do this by:
    1. Clicking on **Environment** in the top right section of your screen.
    2. Clicking on **social_media**.
    3. You should see a new tab pop up with the data in a **table-like format** (this is called a **dataframe**).
    4. Make sure that this new tab looks similar to what you saw when you opened Excel file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="200%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Navigating to dataset"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/All%20images%20for%20computing%20tutorials/Data_wrangling_and_visualization/Directing%20students%20to%20view%20data%20in%20R.gif?raw=true")
```

- We can also do this **programmatically** using the code blocks below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Method 1 - Type in the name of the object
social_media
```

```{r}
# Method 2 - Use the View function
View(social_media) #view automatically displays the dataset in a tab.

```

```{r}
# Method 3 - Use the head function
head(social_media) #head displays the first 6 rows of each variable.

```

```{r}
# Method 4 - Use the str function
str(social_media) #displays an overall summary of the object and variable structure.

```

You should now have a good idea of what `PSYC2001_social-media.csv` looks like in RStudio. This should match what we saw in excel.


You will also notice that the last function, `str()`, displays a **summary** of the object. This includes:

- The **object type** (a **dataframe**)
- The **number of observations/rows** (60)
- The **number of variables/columns** (10)
- The **datatype**: **chr** for **`id`**, and **num** for all other variables

<strong>Question:</strong> Please discuss with your deskmate and tutor what you think **chr** and **num** mean.

```

## Checking the quality of our data

Once we have imported our dataset into R, it’s important to check the quality of the data. One simple way to do this is by using the `summary()` function. 

```{r}
summary(social_media) #summary provides a quick overview of the data in each variable. 
```

<strong>Hint:</strong> Take a closer look at the `time_on_social` variable.
:::

## Cleaning the data

It should now be clear that this data is unusual because it has a **minimum value** of `-999` in the `time_on_social` variable which is measured in hours (we can't have negative time !).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Back to the future !"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/All%20images%20for%20computing%20tutorials/Data_wrangling_and_visualization/Back%20To%20The%20Future%20GIF.gif?raw=true")
```

A good question to ask now is - **why are these values in the dataset?**

Sometimes when collecting data, we can’t get a response from every participant. Instead of leaving a blank, researchers will sometimes put in a placeholder value like `-999` to show that the data is missing. These aren't real numbers; they just mean the data wasn’t recorded. But `-999` isn’t the standard way to show missing data in R. R uses `NA` to represent missing values, and that’s important because most R functions know how to handle `NA` properly but they don’t know to ignore `-999`.

Lets first have a look at how many `-999` values are present in the data. We can do this by using the `filter()` function from the `tidyverse` package which is used to keep (or remove) rows based on certain conditions. 

```{r filtering values without piping}

social_media_filtered <- filter(social_media, time_on_social == -999) #keep all rows where `time_on_social` is equal to -999
View(social_media_filtered) #view the filtered dataframe
```

Handily, we can then use the `count()` function from the `tidyverse` package to sum the number of rows in the resulting dataframe.

```{r counting rows}
count(social_media_filtered) #count the number of rows in the filtered dataframe)
```

## Introducing Piping

A short aside to introduce a **very specical operation called a 'pipe'** or `%>%`. This operation is part of the `tidyverse` package and allows you to pass the result from one function to the next seamlessly in a sort of assembly-line like fashion. **Throughout the rest of the course we will be using 'piping' as it is easier to follow and code**. For instance, lets repeat what we just did above but with pipes instead. 

```{r filtering values with pipes}
social_media %>% #pass the values from social_media to the filter function
  filter(time_on_social == -999) %>% #keep all rows that are equal to -999 and pass the result to count
  count() #count the number of remaining columns

```

::: {style="border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; background-color: #E7F3FE; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;"}
<strong>Info:</strong> Piping is not friends with every function. Some functions will not accept inputs from pipes (no matter how nice they are !). This will become clearer as we code throughout this course.
:::

Now lets use a piping method to clean this data up by replacing `-999` values  with more R readable `NA` values. `NA` stands for 'Not Available' and is the standard way to represent missing data in R. We can do this using the `mutate()` and `na_if()` functions from the `tidyverse` package. The `mutate()` function is used to alter or make new columns in a dataframe based on the conditions we specify and `na_if()` is used to replace given values with `NA` in a dataframe.

```{r}
social_media_NA <- social_media %>%
  mutate(time_on_social = na_if(time_on_social,-999)) #mutate alters columns and rows. na_if replaces -999 with NA
                                                    
```

## Exporting Data

It would be a good idea to save this dataset for future tutorials, so that we don't have to replace `-999` values with `NA` values every single time.

We can do this with the `write.csv()` function from `baseR`. This function takes a dataframe in R and saves it as a .csv file on your computer. Later, we can simply read that csv back into R, and it will already be cleaned.

```{r Saving datasets}

write.csv(social_media_NA, here("Output","PSYC2001_social-media-data-cleaned.csv")) #creates a csv file from the dataframe social_media_NA


```

## Data visualization using `ggplot2`

Visualizing data is a crucial step in data analysis. You should never run a statistical analysis without first visualising your data. It helps us understand the distribution of our data, identify patterns, and communicate our findings effectively. It also helps us identify whether the data is suitable for the analysis we want to perform, or whether some weird values remain that could influence the result of our statistical tests, and even worse, our interpretations!

So, let's look at some data! We’re going to start by visualising the `time_on_social` variable.

To do this we will need to use the `ggplot()` function. This is the main function from the `ggplot2` package (**you should know what this is from reading the documentation**). `ggplot()` provides the canvas of the graph you want to make. 
To make the basic canvas `ggplot()` requires two things:

1. The data that you want it to plot.

2. The variables to go on the x and y axes.

Importantly, `ggplot()` only provides the canvas. It does not draw anything by itself. You have to add layers to the canvas created by `ggplot()` by using other functions that can create bars, points or lines ! 

Here we use `geom_boxplot()` which creates a boxplot for us. What is a boxplot you ask ? A boxplot is a graph that shows the spread of data points where the lower part of the "box" represents the bottom quartile (where 25% of the data lies), the upper part of the box represents the upper quartile (where 75% of the data lies) and the middle of the box represents the median (the middle value). The "whiskers" (vertical lines) extend to the smallest and largest values not considered outliters.

```{r}
social_media_NA %>%
ggplot(aes(y = time_on_social),) + #ggplot uses aesthetic (aes()) to map axes. 
  scale_x_discrete() + #this tells ggplot that the x-axis is categorical.
  geom_boxplot() + #creates a boxplot
  labs(y = "Time on Social Media") #short for "labels", use to label axes and titles.
```

::: {style="border-left: 4px solid #FF9800; background-color: #FFF3E0; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;"}
<strong>Warning:</strong> We receive a warning here because `ggplot()` is able to recognise and remove 'NA' values. Be **careful** as not all R functions are able to do this.
:::


::: {style="border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0; background-color: #F3E5F5; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;"}
<strong>Question:</strong> What approximately is the median value? The lower quartile? The upper quartile? Is there another way that we could get this information in a more exact form ? Discuss this with your deskmate and your tutor.
:::

## Activity 2 - Creating a histogram in `ggplot()`

`ggplot()` can be customised with so many other functions that we have shown here to make truly [beautiful looking plots](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html). We will be learning how to do this throughout the next few weeks. 

For now lets see if you can put some of the skills you have learned so far to good use. See if you can work out how to make a histogram of the data using the function `geom_histogram()` 

::: {style="border-left: 4px solid #00bfa5; background-color: #e0f2f1; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;"}
<strong>Hint:</strong> You will only need to provide an x variable this time !
:::

```{r, eval=FALSE}
social_media_NA %>%
ggplot(aes(x = time_on_social)) + #ggplot uses aesthetic (aes()) to map axes. 
  geom_histogram() + #creates a histogram
  labs(x = "Time on social media", y = "Density") #short for "labels", use to label axes and titles.
```

::: {style="border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0; background-color: #F3E5F5; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;"}
<strong>Question:</strong> What conclusions would you draw about the shape of the data, given your histogram? Please discuss with your deskmate and tutor.
