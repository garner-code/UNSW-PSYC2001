Testing our first hypothesis

Please read me before starting this tutorial.

So far, we have used our data analysis skills to handle and visualize data, as well as using a simple simulation approach to better understand the sampling distribution of the means. 
Today we’re going to work on one of the most critical skills in Psychology – constructing and testing our own hypotheses.

Today we are going to be going back to an older dataset the 'social_media_dataset.csv'. We are going to be looking at two new variables, 'good_mood_likes' and 'bad_mood_likes'.

To recap from previous tutorials these varaibles are: 

- good_mood_likes – average number of likes per 10 minutes of use on the participant’s preferred platform, when they were in a good mood (calculated using platform data combined with diary self-report of mood)
- bad_mood_likes – as above but for bad mood
