Correlations in R.

Please read me before starting this tutorial.

This week, we are adding to our data analysis toolkit with a correlation analysis to explore relationships between continuous variables.

We will be using the 'PSYC2001_social-media-data-cleaned.csv' to explore the relationship age, time on social media and political attitude (a variable composed of informed, campaign and activism)

Here is a recap of the variables:

- age – age in years
- time_on_social – average hours/day on social media (self-report diary)

Political attitude subscales:

- informed – how politically informed they feel (e.g., read news daily)
- campaign – how much they engage in campaign-related discussion
- activism – involvement in activism (e.g., protests, petitions)


In order to complete this class you need to open the following files:

1) The online bookdown link with access to chapter 7 which contains the full set of instructions. 

2) "Correlation_in_R.Rproj" which contains the R project file.

3) "Correlation_in_R.Rmd" which contains the Rmarkdown file.
