Data Wrangling and Visualisation

Please read me before starting the tutorial. 

This week you will be learning about importing CSV data into R, checking and cleaning data and visualising it. 

Before beginning please read the brief summary of the dataset we will be using today. This dataset is called 'PSYC2001_social-media-data.csv'.

Note – the key below is important, and you will need to refer to it throughout weeks 1–10.

This dataset was collected as part of an experiment investigating social media use in young Australian adults. Sixty young adults answered questions about their **social media usage** as well as their **political attitudes**. Data about their **social media usage** (e.g., likes) was collected while they used their preferred platforms under various conditions.

The variables in the data are:

- id – a unique identifier (S1–S60)
- age – age in years
- time_on_social – average hours/day on social media (self-report diary)
- urban – urban (1) or rural (2) area (based on postcode density)
- good_mood_likes – likes/10 min during a good mood (from platform + diary)
- bad_mood_likes – as above, but during bad mood
- followers – average number of followers across platforms

The next 3 columns are political attitude subscales:

- informed – how politically informed they feel (e.g., read news daily)
- campaign – how much they engage in campaign-related discussion
- activism – involvement in activism (e.g., protests, petitions)

You are now ready to start the tutorial. In order to complete this class you need to open the following files:

1) The online bookdown link with access to Chapter 2 which contains the full set of instructions. 

2) "Data_wrangling_and_visualisation.Rproj" which contains the R project file.

3) "Data_wrangling_and_visualisation.Rmd" which contains the Rmarkdown file.
