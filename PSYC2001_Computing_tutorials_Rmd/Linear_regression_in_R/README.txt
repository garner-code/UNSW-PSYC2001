Linear regression in R

Please read me before starting this tutorial.

This week, we are adding predicting the score on one variable using another variable with simple linear regression.

We will be using the 'PSYC2001-social-media-attitutde.csv' to see how well attitude predicts social media use.

Here is a recap of the variables:

- age – age in years
- time_on_social – average hours/day on social media (self-report diary)

Political attitude which is composed of the subscales: 

- informed – how politically informed they feel (e.g., read news daily)
- campaign – how much they engage in campaign-related discussion
- activism – involvement in activism (e.g., protests, petitions)


In order to complete this class you need to open the following files:

1) The online bookdown with access to Chapter 8 which contains the full set of instructions. 

2) "Linear_regression_in_R.Rproj" which contains the R project file.

3) "Linear_regression_in_R.Rmd" which contains the Rmarkdown file.
