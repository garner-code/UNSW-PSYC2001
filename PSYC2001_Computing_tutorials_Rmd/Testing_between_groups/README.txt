Testing between groups

Please read me before starting this tutorial.

This week, we are adding to our data analysis toolkit with a between groups analysis, using an independent samples t-test.  

We will be using the 'PSYC2001_social-media-data-cleaned.csv' to compare a few different variables this weeek.

Here is a recap of the variables:

urban – whether the participant lived in a city/urban location (1) or lived in a rural location (2) - defined using the population density of the participant’s area code
good_mood_likes – average number of likes per 10 minutes of use on the participant’s preferred platform, when they were in a good mood (calculated using platform data combined with diary self-report of mood)
bad_mood_likes – as above but for bad mood
followers – average number of followers across all social media platforms used by the participant

In order to complete this class you need to open the following files:

1)  The online bookdown with access to Chapter 5 which contains the full set of instructions. 

2) "Testing_between_groups.Rproj" which contains the R project file.

3) "Testing_between_groups.Rmd" which contains the Rmarkdown file.
