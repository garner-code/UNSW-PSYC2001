You got the power!

Please read me before starting this tutorial. 

This week, we are going to explore how improving our statistical power changes our ability to detect effects, if they exist. 

Our job as experimenters is to make the most educated guess that we can about the effect size we are looking for, and make sure our study is appropriately powered to give us the best chance to detect it, if it even exists.
The best chance we have to change statistical power is to change our sample size.

This week we will be using the `global_social_media.csv` dataset that we have used previously. Please recall that this dataset is a repeat of the social media study at 500 universities across the world, to get an in-depth global understanding of social media use in young adults.

The following is a brief summary of this dataset:

The dataset contains 2 variables: uni_id and mean_time_on_social

uni_id: University ID number. Like the subject ID from last computing lab, but for each university taking part in the study. UNSW’s ID is ‘U49'. USYDs ID is 'U102'
mean_time_on_social: the mean recorded for time_on_social from each experiment, where each experiment was conducted at a different university.
