# Course Information {-}

## The purpose of this coursebook

Welcome to the computing tutorials for PSYC2001. This coursebook has been designed to support your learning of statistics through hands-on practice with R. It accompanies the RMarkdown tutorial documents available on Moodle and will guide you through the more code-heavy components of the course. The focus is not just on memorising but on learning how to think about data, ask good questions, and use R as a tool to answer them. 

## Structure of the Coursebook

Each chapter introduces a key concept in statistics. You will often see worked examples with code that runs in R. These examples show you how to apply statistical techniques step by step. Throughout the chapters, you will also find incomplete code blocks. These are practice opportunities for you to fill in the missing parts. Completing these code blocks is important, because your goal at the end of each tutorial is to be able to reproduce the coursebook chapter using the RMarkdown code. More importantly, it will help you move from simply reading code to actively writing and using it. Throughout this course book there will be questions that encourage you to think about about or apply what you've learned in new situation. 



## To-do 
- Add a bit about coding philosophy and bugs.  
- add a bit about why.
- amend the structure of the coursebook info above.
All of the UNSW School of Psychology computers have R and R Studio installed, however, we can only guarantee that the computers in the Level 2 psychology labs have the right set-up. 

- amend this: Both R and RStudio are freely available so you may wish to install them on your own machine. There is a useful [guide to installing them both here](https://psyteachr.github.io/hack-your-data/r_instructions.html) that you can use. Note that the PSYC2001 staff are unable to help you if you have specific technical issues setting up R and RStudio on your own machine. But the tutors can support you using R and RStudio on the School of Psychology computers in the computer labs. If you are having specific technical issues setting this up on your own machine, then you should submit an issue to UNSW IT Services.
