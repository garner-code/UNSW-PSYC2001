### **Checking installation and loading packages**

Before we can **begin** any script we first need to make sure that the **required packages are installed** in our version of RStudio. Next, we can **load the required packages** to be used in the script. The code block below will do this for you.

```{r checking and loading in packages, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# Check if packages are installed, if not install.
if(!require(here)) install.packages('here') #checks if a package is installed and installs it if required.
if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages('tidyverse')
if(!require(ggplot2)) install.packages('ggplot2')

library(here) #loads in the specified package
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

### **What do packages do?**

You should be able to see that we have installed and loaded **3 different packages**. Let's first go over the basics of what a package is. In its simplest terms, a **package is a toolbox** that someone has created for us in R that **makes our life easier**. These packages build on the basic code that comes with the R programming language (what **RStudio** uses to run), called `base R`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 1: Opening an R package"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/Tutorial%202/Lab%202%20images/Opening%20an%20R%20package.gif?raw=true")
```

### **What do these packages do?**

It is always a **good idea to check the documentation** for a package before you use it. We can do this by using the **help syntax**, which is the `?`. The package we are trying to get help with is called `here`. Try to run this code by **clicking on the green arrow on the corner of the code block on the left side of your screen**. This will open a webpage that tells us the **purpose** of the `here` package and how it works.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 2: Running code in R"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/Tutorial%202/Lab%202%20images/Example%20of%20running%20code.jpg?raw=true")
```


```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
?here #? loads the documentation for a specified package.
```

### **Activity 1 - Using help syntax**

**Fill in the code block below** by putting in the **help syntax** `?` and the name of the package you are interested in. This will get the documentation for the **other packages** we are using. You can do this by substituting in the packages that we are using from above. Have a read of each of these pages and click on any links you find interesting. These are the **main packages** we will be using throughout this course.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Try to use the help function '?' to read more about the packages we are using today
# The packages we are using are 'tidyverse' and 'ggplot2'.

?tidyverse
?ggplot2
```

### **Importing your data** {#importing}

The dataset we are using has already been downloaded in the folder containing this **R Markdown file**. On your computer navigate to this folder and have a look at what it contains.

You should note that it contains the following:

- An R Project file called **'Tutorial_2-Data_wrangling_and_visualization.Rproj'**
- An R Markdown file called  **'Tutorial_2-Data_wrangling_and_visualization.Rmd'**.
- A HTML files called **Tutorial_2-Data_wrangling_and_visualisation.html'**
- A text file called **Tutorial_2-Data_wrangling_and_visualisation_ReadME.txt'**
- A folder called **data**, containing a .csv file called **'PSYC2001_social-media-data.csv'**
- A folder called **output**, which is where all your output will go. 
- A folder called **scripts** which is where all new scripts will go.  

These are the **key ingredients needed to organise all projects in R**.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 3: Project Organisation"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/Tutorial%202/Lab%202%20images/Figure%202.JPG?raw=true")
```


You will notice that the data for today, called `PSYC2001_social-media-data.csv`, is a **csv file** (short for a *Comma Separated Value* file). This means that we will need to **import the dataset** using a function capable of importing csv files. 

We will be using **two different functions** to achieve this. The `read.csv()` function is used to import our csv dataset and it comes from the `utils` package which is part of `base R`. But the `read.csv()` function needs to know where the file is coming from. To do this, we use the `here()` function from the `here` package. This function tells R the **location of the project** we are working from, to make locating the data easier.

Let's first confirm that `here()` knows our current location on this pc (called the **'Working Directory'**)

```{r}
here()
```

We can use this to easily find where our file is located and read it.

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
social_media <- read.csv(file = here("Data","PSYC2001_social-media-data.csv")) #reads in csv files

```

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #FF9800; background-color: #FFF3E0; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> If you have an error, something has gone wrong—please ask your tutor for help!</div>

### **Having a look at our imported data**

Our data should now be **imported into R!**

The first thing we should do whenever we import data is to **see how it looks in RStudio**. There are a couple of ways to do this.

- The first way is to **manually click** through to the dataset. You can do this by:
    1. Clicking on **Environment** in the top right section of your screen.
    2. Clicking on **social_media**.
    3. You should see a new tab pop up with the data in a **table-like format** (this is called a **dataframe**).
    4. Make sure that this new tab looks similar to what you are seeing in the opened Excel file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="200%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 4: Navigating to dataset"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/Tutorial%202/Lab%202%20images/Figure%204.gif?raw=true")
```

- We can also do this **programmatically** using the code blocks below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Method 1 - Type in the name of the object
social_media
```

```{r}
# Method 2 - Use the View function
View(social_media) #view automatically displays the dataset in a tab.

```

```{r}
# Method 3 - Use the head function
head(social_media) #head displays the first 6 rows of each variable.

```

```{r}
# Method 4 - Use the str function
str(social_media) #displays an overall summary of the object and variable structure.

```

You should now have a good idea of what `PSYC2001_social-media.csv` looks like in RStudio.

You will also notice that the last function, `str()`, displays a **summary** of the object. This includes:

- The **object type** (a **dataframe**)
- The **number of observations/rows** (60)
- The **number of variables/columns** (10)
- The **datatype**: **chr** for **`id`**, and **num** for all other variables

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0; background-color: #F3E5F5; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <strong>Question:</strong> Please discuss with your deskmate and tutor what you think **chr** and **num** mean.</div>


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 5: You thinking"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/Tutorial%202/Lab%202%20images/Students%20thinking.gif?raw=true")
```

### **Checking the quality of our data** {#quality}

Once we have imported our dataset into R, it’s important to check the quality and structure of the data to ensure everything looks as expected. One simple way to do this is by using the `summary()` function. 

```{r}
summary(social_media) #summary provides a quick overview of the data in each variable. 
```

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0; background-color: #F3E5F5; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <strong>Question:</strong> Do you notice anything unusual in the output of this data ? Discuss with your neighbour and tutor</div>


<div style="border-left: 4px solid #00bfa5; background-color: #e0f2f1; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <strong>Hint:</strong> Take a closer look at the `time_on_social` variable.</div>

---

### **Cleaning the data**

It should now be clear that this data is unusual because it has a **minimum value** of `-999` in the time_on_social variable which is measured in hours (we can't have negative time !).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 6: Back to the future !"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/BsoCool/UNSW-PSYC2001/blob/main/Tutorial%202/Lab%202%20images/Back%20To%20The%20Future%20GIF.gif?raw=true")
```

A good question to ask now is - **why are these values in the dataset?**

Sometimes when collecting data, we can’t get a response from every participant. Instead of leaving a blank, researchers will sometimes put in a placeholder value like `-999` to show that the data is missing. These aren't real numbers; they just mean the data wasn’t recorded. But `-999` isn’t the standard way to show missing data in R. R uses `NA` to represent missing values, and that’s important because most R functions know how to handle `NA` properly—but they don’t know to ignore `-999`.

Lets first have a look at how many `-999` values are present in the data. We can do this by using the `filter()` function from the `tidyverse` package which is used to keep (or remove) rows based on certain conditions. We can then use the `count()` function from the `tidyverse` package to sum the number of rows in the dataframe.

```{r filtering values without piping}

social_media_filtered <- filter(social_media, time_on_social == -999) #keep all rows where `time_on_social` is equal to -999
count(social_media_filtered) #count the total number of rows remaining the dataframe and print it to the console. 
```

### **Introducing Piping**

A short aside to introduce a **very specical operation called a 'pipe'** or `%>%`. This operation allows you to pass the result from one function to the next seamlessly in a sort of assembly line like fashion. **Throughout the rest of the course we will be using 'piping' as it is easier to follow and code**. For instance, lets repeat what we just did above but with pipes instead. 

```{r filtering values with pipes}
social_media %>% #pass the values from social_media to the filter function
  filter(time_on_social == -999) %>% #keep all rows that are equal to -999 and pass the result to count
  count() #count the number of remaining columns

```

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; background-color: #E7F3FE; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <strong>Info:</strong> Piping is not friends with every functions. Some functions will not accept inputs from pipes (not matter how nice they are !). This will become clearer as we code of this course</div>


Now lets use a piping method to clean this data up and remove `-999` and replace them with more R readable `NA` values.  
We can do this using the `mutate()` and `na_if()` functions from the `tidyverse` package. The `mutate()` function is used to alter columnsin dataframe based on certain conditions and `na_if()` is used to replace given values with `NA` in a dataframe.

```{r}
social_media_NA <- social_media %>%
  mutate(time_on_social = na_if(time_on_social,-999)) #mutate alters columns and rows.
                                                      #na_if replaces -999 with NA.
```

### **Data visualization using `ggplot2`** {#visualisation}

Now let's look at some data! We’re going to start by visualising the `time_on_social` variable. Visualising helps us understand more about the distribution of the data, which helps us understand what kinds of analysis we can perform.

To do this we will need to use the `ggplot()` function. This is the main function from the `ggplot2` package (**you should know what this is from reading the documentation**). `ggplot()` provides the canvas of the graph you want to make. 

To make the basic canvas `ggplot()` requires two things:

1. The data that you want it to plot.

2. The variables to go on the x and y axes.

Importantly, `ggplot()` only provides the canvas. It does not draw anything by itself. You have to add layers to the canvas created by `ggplot()` by using other functions that can create bars, points or lines ! 

Here we use `geom_boxplot()` which creates a boxplot for us. 

```{r}
social_media_NA %>%
ggplot(aes(y = time_on_social),) + #ggplot uses aesthetic (aes()) to map axes. 
  scale_x_discrete() + #this tells ggplot that the x-axis is categorical.
  geom_boxplot() + #creates a boxplot
  labs(y = "Time on Social Media") #short for "labels", use to label axes and titles.
```

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #FF9800; background-color: #FFF3E0; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> We receive a warning here because `ggplot()` is able to recognise and remove 'NA' values. Be **careful** as not all R functions are able to do this.</div>

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0; background-color: #F3E5F5; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <strong>Question:</strong> What approximately is the median value? The lower quartile? The upper quartile? Is there another way that we could get this information in a more exact form ? Discuss this with your deskmate and your tutor.</div>

### **Activity 2 - Creating a histogram in `ggplot()`**

`ggplot()` can be customised with so many other functions that we have shown here to make truly [beautiful looking plots](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html). We will be learning how to do this throughout the next few weeks. 

For now lets see if you can put some of the skills you have learned so far to good use. See if you can work out how to make a histogram of the data using the function `geom_histogram()` 

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #00bfa5; background-color: #e0f2f1; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <strong>Hint:</strong> You will only need to provide an x variable this time !</div>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
social_media_NA %>%
ggplot(aes(x = time_on_social)) + #ggplot uses aesthetic (aes()) to map axes. 
  geom_histogram() + #creates a histogram
  labs(x = "Time on social media", y = "Density") #short for "labels", use to label axes and titles.
```


<div style="border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0; background-color: #F3E5F5; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
  <strong>Question:</strong> What conclusions would you draw about the shape of the data, given your histogram? Please discuss with your deskmate and tutor. </div>


Well done ! You have completed everything you need to for this week. If you have finished in a record time please consult with your tutor about what to do next. Otherwise we will see you next lab !
