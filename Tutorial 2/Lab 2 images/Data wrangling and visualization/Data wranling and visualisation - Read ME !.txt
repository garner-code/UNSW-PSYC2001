Please read me before starting the Week 2 Lab. 

This week you will be learning about importing CSV data into R, checking and cleaning data and visualising it. 

Before beginning please read the brief summary of the dataset we will be using today. This dataset is called social_media_dataset.

Note – the key below is important, and you will need to refer to it throughout weeks 1–10.

This dataset was collected as part of an experiment investigating social media use in young Australian adults. Sixty young adults answered questions about their **social media usage** as well as their **political attitudes**. Data about their **social media usage** (e.g., likes) was collected while they used their preferred platforms under various conditions.

The variables in the data are:

- id – a unique identifier (S1–S60)
- age – age in years
- time_on_social – average hours/day on social media (self-report diary)
- urban – urban (1) or rural (2) area (based on postcode density)
- good_mood_likes** – likes/10 min during a good mood (from platform + diary)
- bad_mood_likes – as above, but during bad mood
- followers – average number of followers across platforms

The next 3 columns are political attitude subscales:

- informed – how politically informed they feel (e.g., read news daily)
- campaign – how much they engage in campaign-related discussion
- activism – involvement in activism (e.g., protests, petitions)

You are now ready to start the tutorial. To begin the tutorial click on the folder "Scripts" then on the file "Lab 1 Script". This will open an Rmarkdown file in Rstudio. 
This file will contain all the instructions needed to complete this tutorial. Please make sure to click "Knit" to see the nicer looking version of instructions.
