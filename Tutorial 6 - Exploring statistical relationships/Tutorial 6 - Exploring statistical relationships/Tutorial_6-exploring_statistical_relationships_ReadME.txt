Tutorial 6 - Exploring statistical relationships.

Please read me before starting the sixth computing class. 

This week, we are going to explore relationships between continuous variables, using correlation and regression.

We will be using the 'social_media_dataset.csv' to explore relationships between a few new variables this week. 


Here is a recap of the variables:

age – the participant’s age in years

time_on_social – average amount of time spent on social media each day, in hours (recorded using a self-report diary method over a month)

The next 3 variables for today are scores from subscales of a questionnaire that measures political attitudes. Participants responded to questions on a scale of 0-7, and each column shows the average response for that subscale. The subscales are:

informed – a self-report rating of how politically informed the person is. This section has questions like ‘I read news stories everyday’, and ‘I follow election coverage to inform my voting preferences’

campaign – as above but for how much campaigning the person does within the political system; includes questions such as ‘In the run up to elections, I discuss political issues with my relatives who may vote differently to me’ and ‘I participate in door-knocking campaigns for my preferred political party’

activism – as above but for how much the person engages in political activism. Questions include ‘I attended at least one protest march in the past few months’ and ‘I often sign online petitions for causes I am aligned with’
