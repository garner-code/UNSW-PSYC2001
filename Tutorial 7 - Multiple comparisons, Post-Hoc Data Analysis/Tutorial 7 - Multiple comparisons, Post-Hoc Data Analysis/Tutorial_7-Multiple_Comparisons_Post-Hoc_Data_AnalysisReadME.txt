Tutorial 7 - Multiple Comparisons, Post-Hoc Data Analysis

Please read me before starting the seventh computing class. 

This week, In this lab, we will visting the many labs project, and use the data to look at the topics of multiple comparisons and post-hoc data analysis. 
The many labs project involved 36 labs from around the world who all ran the same set of 13 psychology experiments. 
We will only focus on one of the experiments that they replicated here - the currency/ money priming experiment.

We will be using the 'PSYC2001_means-currency.csv' to look at multiple comparisons and posthoc analysis.  

The datafile should contain the following variables.

You should see a file with eight columns. The columns tell us:

‘lab’: number indicating the lab in which this version of the experiment was conducted

‘controlMean’: average system justification for control participants in this location

‘controlSD’: standard deviation of the system justification scores for control participants in this location

‘moneyMean’: average system justification for money primed participants

‘moneySD’: standard deviation of system justification scores for money priming participants

‘diffMean’: The difference between the mean system justification scores for the money and control conditions

‘diffSE’: The pooled standard error term of the difference between sample means for the money and control conditions

‘dfPerLab’: The degrees of freedom for the experiment in this sample. This is the total number of participants tested minus two.

In order to complete this class you need to open the following files:

1) "Tutorial_7-Multiple_Comparisons_Post-Hoc_Data_Analysis.html" which contains the full set of instructions. 

2) "Tutorial_7-Multiple_Comparisons_Post-Hoc_Data_Analysis.Rproj" which contains the R project file.

3) "Tutorial_7-Multiple_Comparisons_Post-Hoc_Data_Analysis.Rmd" which contains the Rmarkdown file.
